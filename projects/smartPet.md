# 🐾 SmartPet: Virtual AI Companion

**SmartPet** is an interactive virtual pet application powered by AI technologies. It simulates realistic conversations, emotional responses, and customizable pet behaviors — all within a lightweight Unity interface.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build an intelligent virtual pet system
- Enable natural language interaction using GPT-style models
- Support emotion simulation and basic needs (hunger, energy, attention)
- Learn Unity UI, state machines, and Lua hot-reload

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Unity** (C#) – game logic, UI, animations
- **Lua** – hot-update system for rapid development
- **GPT API / Chat** – backend NLP processing (simulated locally or via mock)
- **JSON** – behavior & response templates
- **Docker** – dev environment containerization

---

## 🧩 Core Features

- 💬 AI dialogue system (pre-scripted + GPT-generated fallback)
- 😊 Mood tracking system (affection, hunger, energy, boredom)
- 📈 Pet behavior state machine (idle, play, sleep, eat)
- 🔄 Lua hot-reloading for live debugging
- 🎨 Custom pet skin/theme switcher

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure scalable Unity projects using MVC-ish pattern
- Integrating Lua for runtime control
- Building a simple dialogue engine with memory
- Handling async GPT-style interactions without blocking UI
- Managing stateful behaviors in game-like interfaces

---

## 🚧 Known Issues

- GPT interaction fallback may lag on poor network
- Limited device adaptation (currently optimized for desktop)
